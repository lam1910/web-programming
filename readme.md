1. Since google drive does not support html file, all html files will be convert to a google docs file when updated. I just update file to serve as a placholder
2. Actual code can be found at [web programming github](https://github.com/lam1910/web-programming)
3. if you still wanted to see in google drive, I just changed the file extension from html to txt. if you download to your local computer, do change it back before use (the ones on git is still .html)
4. update on 27/3/2020: due to my negligence, I mistook the calculate about who i am going to review. All previous reviews will be scraped and new reviews will be added.
