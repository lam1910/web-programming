1. Since google drive does not support html file, all html files will be convert to a google docs file when updated. I just update file to serve as a placholder
2. Actual code can be found at [web programming github](https://github.com/lam1910/web-programming)
3. if you still wanted to see in google drive, I just changed the file extension from html to txt. if you download to your local computer, do change it back before use (the ones on git is still .html)
